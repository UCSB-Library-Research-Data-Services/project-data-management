title: "Data Management Plan"
---

In a nutshell, **your goal as a Data Manager is to organize your team in a way that will let you document and preserve your work** - including raw and derived data when possible. When delivering a project to a client, it is important to make sure the client can both understand and reuse the products (code, data, apps) you have developed.

Having a plan to manage your data will save you from some potential painful hiccups and therefore save you time s your progress through your project data life cycle. In other words, it is time well spent to develop your data management plan. Note that the team discussion necessary to develop you plan is as important as the plan itself as the questions you will have to answer will help you to think more about your data (what type, how much of it, how are you going to process it,…) and also define who is going to do what on your team.

In the end, the goal is to archive your data in a data repository such as [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash). Here is an example of a previous group archive: https://doi.org/10.25349/D97G9Z  – especially look at the README describing the content.


## Developing your Data Management Plan (DMP)

Here are a set of general questions that will help your team to think about the data and resources your will need along the data lifecycle of your project.




## Data Management Plan Tool

There is a tool that you can use to guide your process: the DMP Tool. It is a little bit like an online form on steroids. Note that you do not have to use this tool for your project, but from our experience, it provides good guidance for this process.
