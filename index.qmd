This website aims at helping graduate students conducting their first data-intensive project to plan and manage their data with a reproducible mindset.

We provide advice on:

1.  How to develop your Data Management Plan (DMP)
2.  How to manage and document your data to ease the preservation of your work, so others (including future-you) can reuse it.
3.  How to preserve and share your data using a data repository
