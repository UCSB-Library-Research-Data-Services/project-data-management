# Good enough practices to manage and preserve your project data

This website aims at helping graduate students conducting their first large project to plan and manage their data with a reproducible mindset.

We provide advice on 1) how to develop your Data Management Plan (DMP) and 2) how to manage and document your data to ease the preservation of your work, so others (including your future self) can reuse it.
