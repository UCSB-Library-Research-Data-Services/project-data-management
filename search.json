    "text": "What scientific products to preserve?\nOften the first question that comes to mind when starting to preserve your work is: What should I include in my data archive? Generally speaking, you want to preserve ** your** work. This means capturing the methodology you used, the raw data you collected, any data cleaning you did, and any data and output (figure, report, …) you generated. Okay… so you mean everything!? Well, yes and no. Everything that was relevant to help you to come to the findings and conclusions discussed in your report (or any other publications). Let’s break this down.\n\nRaw data\nHere are a few questions to ask yourself to determine if you should refer in your documentation to the raw data you used or also include them in your data archive.\n\nThe raw data is already publicly accessible and the hosting solution (website, FTP server, …) seems well maintained (ideally providing a way to cite the data)\n\n\n=&gt; Document the website or process you used to collect the data and when you did access/download the data you used. Try also to determine if there is a version number associated with the data you used.*\n\n\nThe raw data is not publicly accessible\n\nNote we are not talking about data under a non-disclosure agreement here, but more about data with an unclear reuse status or that were obtained by interactions with a person or an institution. For example, if the data you used were sent to you privately, then we recommend that you:\n\n\ninquire with your person of contact about the status of licensing and if they would be willing to let you share those data publicly. You might face resistance at first so take the time to explain why you think it is valuable to your work to also share those data sets.\nif in the end, it is not possible to share the data please still describe the data in your documentation and list the contact information (person or institution) to inquire about this data set.\n\n\n\n\nIntermediate data\nThis is data you generated either while cleaning or analyzing the raw data. You should preserve it if:\n\nit was not directly generated by a script (otherwise preserve the code instead)\nit has reusable value. For example, cleaned-up versions of raw data can be very valuable for others to reuse!\n\n\n\nCode\nScripting your analytical workflow from the raw data to the end products is a great way to make your work more reproducible and more reusable by others. We thus strongly encourage your team to develop code to process and analyze data. Cloud-based code repository services, such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket and more, are a great way to both manage and preserve your code.\nThose services are often well integrated with data repositories letting you link your code repository with your data archive. They also offer a way to tag a specific version of your code to make sure it is the exact code that you used for a specific analysis.\n\n\nFinal products\nWe recommend including any data set used to produce statistics, figures maps, and other visualizations that were used in your work, in this case even if generated by scripts."

However, we encourage you to discuss with your Faculty Advisor to determine if other data repository options specific to your project topic could be more targeted to your project audience. If you would like to research on your own which data repository could be best for your project, the registry of research data repositories is a great resource to do so: https://www.re3data.org/\n\nDRYAD\nDRYAD is the institutional data repository for UCSB and is free of use for any affiliated researcher.

It removes the need to buy specific software to open your data and also ensures that this format will be still readable in the longer term.\n\n\nChoosing a license\nThis can become quickly an overwhelming subject. In an nutshell, Creative Commons licenses are the ones that are favored to license data.\n\n\n\nFoter, CC BY-SA 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nNote that often data repositories will support a certain number of licenses so this can be a parameter to help you choose which data repository you would like to use.

    "text": "Documenting your work\nTo make your archiving process the most efficient, it is key to document your work as you progress throughout your project. If you do so, archiving your data will consist of collecting existing information about the various parts of your project rather than developing it from scratch a few months after you have generated this specific dataset.\nAdd image about the power of README\n\nMetadata\nMetadata aims at describing your data with enough information that should let you be able to reuse this data even if you know nothing about this specific dataset. It is sometimes defined as data about data. So what should you include? Here are some pointers:\n\nDescribe the contents of data files. If you are using complex jargon or concepts make sure you refer to external vocabulary or clearly define these terms as used in your project\nKeep data entry consistent\nDefine the parameters and the units on the parameter\nExplain the formats for date, time, geographic coordinates, and other parameters\nDefine any coded values or acronyms used (in the data or headers)\nDescribe quality flags or qualifying values\nDefine missing values\nAlways use an established metadata standard\n\nNote that there are existing metadata standards that can help you to structure your data in a systematic way. Some data repositories offer web forms that let you enter metadata information in a way that is compatible with those standards.\n\n\nREADME\nREADME files are not a new thing, they have been around computer-based projects since the early days and have been proven to be very valuable to describe content. For your main project README we recommend compiling the following information about your data:\n\nData sources: where did you get your raw data from?\nProvenance: what data set you used/combined to generate your new data\nLicense & permissions: state under which license your data sets are released so others know what they can do with your data\nMethodology: describe the methodology used for your projects\nData listing: list all your data and their potential relationships\nMetadata: add the metadata you developed earlier for each of your data set\n\nNote that you should not feel limited to one README only. It is a great practice to also have READMEs in any subfolder/section of your project that has complex organization and might explanations on how to navigate the file structure or in which order files should be combined.\nOur team has prepared a README template for your submission to Dryad. Note that some sections might not be relevant to your project and you should simply delete those as you move through filling out this template."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In a nutshell, your goal as a Data Manager is to organize your team in a way that will let you document and preserve your work - including raw and derived data when possible. When delivering a project to a client, it is important to make sure the client can both understand and reuse the products (code, data, apps) you have developed. For those reasons more and more funders are requiring a data management plan as part of their proposal submission process and therefore it is a great skill to develop.\nHaving a plan to manage your data will save you from some potential painful hiccups and therefore save you time as your progress through your project data life cycle. In other words, it is time well spent to develop your data management plan and the earlier in your project, you have a good sense of how you are going to manage your data, the better. The team discussion necessary to develop your plan is as important as the plan itself since the questions you will have to answer will help you to think more about your data (what type, how much of it, how are you going to process it,…) and also define who is going to do what on your team.\nYour overarching goal is to archive and share your data in a publicly accessible data repository such as Dryad as your project is completed or important milestones are achieved. For your work to be reproducible, metadata and documentation need to also be developed as well as the scripts you have developed for your analysis. Here is an example of a previous group archive: https://doi.org/10.25349/D97G9Z – especially look at the README.md describing the content.\nBefore writing your plan, we recommend you get familiar with the FAIR and CARE principles to guide your process."

    "text": "Developing your Data Management Plan (DMP)\nHere are a set of general questions that will help your team to think about the data and resources your will need along the data lifecycle of your project.\n\nDescribing the research data: Provide a description of the data the group will collect or re-use, including the file types, data set size, the number of expected files or sets, content, and source of the data (creator and method of collection).\n\nWhat data are needed?\nAre such data available?\nWhen and how will the data be acquired?\n\nData standards:\n\nAre there any standard formats in the specific research field for managing or disseminating the data sets that have been identified (e.g., XML, ASCII, CSV, .shp, .gdb, GeoTIFF)?\nWho from the group will have responsibility for ensuring that data standards are properly applied and data are properly formatted?\n\nMetadata: Metadata is documentation that helps make data sets reusable. Think about what details (metadata) someone would need in order to be able to understand and use these files. For example, perhaps a readme.txt file is necessary to explain variables, the structure of the files, etc. In addition, metadata should follow disciplinary standards, including ontologies and vocabularies. If applicable, describe how the group’s models, scripts, and/or workflows will be documented.\nData sharing and access The data may have significant value for other researchers beyond this project, and sharing this data is part of the group’s responsibility as members of the scientific community. Specify the extent to which data can be reused, including any access limitations. List any proprietary software that might be needed to read the files. If some data is not appropriate for sharing due to confidentiality, NDA, or disclosure risk, then describe that here.\nIntellectual property and re-use: If data were collected from the client organization, does the group have the right to redistribute it? If so, are there any restrictions on redistribution? If the group created its data files, will it assign a Creative Commons license to its data?\nData archiving and preservation: Throughout the project, the group may produce a large number of files. At the end of the project, groups must submit data produced by the project (except data protected by non-disclosure agreements) and when relevant raw data as well. Not all data needs to be saved. Here are some questions to ask yourselves:\n\nIf another researcher wanted to replicate the group’s work or re-use the group’s data, what data and documentation would be required for them to do so?\n\nWhere will the data and metadata be stored after the project is completed?\nIs there a subject-specific and/or open-access repository that is appropriate for the data?\n\n\nOne advantage to depositing your data in a data repository is that you can then get a DOI that will let you easily share and cite your data. Most of the data repositories also track the number of views and downloads your data archive is getting."
